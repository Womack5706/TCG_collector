# TCG_collector
Program For Building A List For Your Collection Of Yugioh TCG Cards Via Card Codes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This Program Was Built As A Self-Taught Lesson To Learn Python, While Organizing My Yugioh Collection Into a .Csv File For Faster Referencing When Selling Or Buying Cards Online. The Card Database Referenced When Searching A Card Is A Modified Version of 
@Pietracoops - Yugioh_cardlist_scraper -- https://github.com/Pietracoops/yugioh_cardlist_scraper
The Scraper Created Each Card Pack With Every Card Possible For That Pack In a Csv File Originally, I simply Compiled those Workbooks
Then Created A Python Module Of The Compiled Files.
